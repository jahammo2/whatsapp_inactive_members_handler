##

* You were trying to read io data from a file
* Start by repeating the uploading of a file

##

* Build out your E2E tests
* Continue with `mix test test/whatsapp_inactive_members_handler/phone_number`

##

* You need a route for getting all costing requests. Page load fails
* Update this to basic: WhatsappInactiveMembersHandlerWeb.PageController
  - You were playing around with it to actually return data from the API
  - Call your Cypress tests to make sure it all works

##

* You have an error coming from your browser. It's from the costing request page/component
